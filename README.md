# Image-to-true-black - an "OLED wallpaper helper" that enables you to leverage "true black" values

This is a very simple web app which you can run locally on your computer.

It allows you to **open an image** and replace dark colors with **true black**. There is a selector that allows you to set a threshold - values below that threshold will lead to all black values.


This is just a very basic app to help out a friend - feel free to make it better any time.
